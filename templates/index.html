            <h1>CPKC Fuel Efficiency Dashboard</h1>
            <p>
                This dashboard is developed to **analyze and optimize train operations for CPKC (Canadian Pacific Kansas City)** by predicting and managing fuel consumption. 
                Fuel costs represent one of the largest operating expenses in railway operations, meaning efficient fuel management directly leads to **massive operational cost savings**. 
                This system aims to maximize operational efficiency and generate financial benefits through data-driven decision-making.

                <div class="description">
                    This is the total fuel consumption aggregated from simulated historical data. 
                    It's crucial for understanding the overall scale of fuel usage across operations.

                <div class="description">
                    Average fuel consumed per kilometer traveled. This metric indicates the overall fuel efficiency of train operations; 
                    a lower value signifies more efficient operation.

                This chart displays the trend of total monthly fuel consumption extracted from historical data. 
                It allows for intuitive understanding of how seasonal factors and changes in operational patterns impact fuel consumption, 
                and helps visually identify anomalies or areas requiring improvement.

            <h2>Predict Fuel Consumption & Optimization Recommendations</h2>
            <p class="description">
                By entering train operational conditions (distance, speed, weight, weather), 
                the machine learning model predicts the estimated fuel consumption for those conditions and 
                provides tailored recommendations for more efficient operation. 
                This information directly contributes to fuel cost reduction when planning operations.
