# CPKC_Fuel_Efficiency_Dashboard# CPKC Fuel Efficiency Dashboard: Optimizing Operations for Cost Savings

## Project Overview

For a large-scale railway company like **CPKC (Canadian Pacific Kansas City)**, fuel is one of the largest operating expenses. Even a small percentage of fuel savings can translate into millions of dollars in annual cost reductions. This project presents a **web-based dashboard** designed to predict train fuel consumption and provide optimization recommendations, directly contributing to significant operational cost savings.

This dashboard leverages simulated train operational data to:
1.  **Predict** fuel consumption based on various factors (distance, speed, weight, weather).
2.  **Simulate** potential fuel savings through optimized strategies.
3.  Provide **actionable recommendations** to train operators or dispatchers.
4.  **Visualize** historical fuel consumption trends for easy understanding.

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in **data science (predictive modeling), full-stack development (Flask web application), data visualization (Chart.js), and a clear understanding of business value creation (direct cost reduction)**. It's built to be accessible even to non-technical users, making data-driven decisions easy and intuitive.

## Key Features

* **Predictive Fuel Consumption Model**: A machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) trained on simulated data to accurately predict fuel usage for a given train journey.
* **Interactive Web Dashboard (Flask)**: A user-friendly interface allowing users to input train parameters and instantly see predicted fuel consumption and potential savings.
* **Optimization Recommendations**: Provides practical suggestions to reduce fuel based on input conditions.
* **Historical Data Visualization (Chart.js)**: Displays monthly fuel consumption trends, offering insights into past performance and identifying areas for improvement.
* **Direct Cost Savings Focus**: Explicitly highlights potential fuel (and thus cost) savings, making the business impact clear.
* **Scalability**: The modular design allows for integration with real-time data sources and more complex optimization algorithms in the future.
